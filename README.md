# Login SPA (Single Page Application)

This is a responsive login form built using React for the front-end. It features email and password sign-in and has been implemented with a focus on UX, attention to detail, and accessibility. For this project, the backend is mocked using `fetch()` for demonstration purposes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to both desktop and mobile screen sizes.
- **Mocked Backend:** `fetch()` is used to simulate the submission of email and password data to a server.
- **Form Validation:** Basic form validation is included to ensure the correct format of email and password.
- **Accessibility:** The application is built with accessibility in mind, with proper labels, focus states, and semantic HTML.
